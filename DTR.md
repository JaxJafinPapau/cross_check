Project -
Group Member Names: Jeremy Bennett, Alek Aker

Project Expectations: Will hopefully gain the knowledge to work with large databases, in a confident way.

Goals and expectations: Complete project through iteration 5 with an emphasis on learning.

Team strengths: We are a team composed of level headedness, realistic expectations and good work ethic.

How to overcome obstacles -
Schedule Expectations: To stay at Turing until at least 7 if necessary and that messages on slack are good until 10pm.

Communication Expectations: Will expect to see each other everyday in school, and will use slack on weekends.

Abilities Expectations: We share a difficulty in putting the bigger picture together and will work to remedy this over the duration of our project.

Workload Expectations: Will create are over arching classes during class work time and after class together. Seperate methods for iterations can be completed seperately if possible


Workflow Expectations: Will use a few tools including Waffle.io to streamline our git work flow, however not to the point of losing out learning experience.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We expect to receive constructive and honest feedback

Agenda to discuss project launch: Sort data we have and assign to their respective classes.
Ideas: Group attributes by class interaction ie: Team class will hold team statistics.

Tools: Waffle.io to look at our git work flow (does not change git in any way)
